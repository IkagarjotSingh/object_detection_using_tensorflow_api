# object_detection_using_tensorflow_api
Aim : Detect Objects in Remote Sensory Imaging

Dataset : [DIOR dataset](http://www.escience.cn/people/gongcheng/DIOR.html) . For this project, considering only Airplanes, Ships, Vehicles.

Technique Used : [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview)

Tensorflow API provides a collection of pre-trained detection models pre-trained.
These models can be useful for out-of-the-box inference or for initializing our models when training on novel datasets (DIOR Dataset in this case).
For this project I used COCO SSD MobileNet v1 model which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).


Detailed Steps can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VBOMjQGxhJQhtDPWAkVA-VI33GLrj6sE).
